The graph of the function is an axis-symmetric figure; 2. The graph of the function is a point-symmetric figure; 3. When x > 0, the function has a minimum value; 4. The point (1, 4) lies on the graph of the function; 5. When x < 1 or x > 3, y > 4.",
        "answer": "1. 2. When x changes to -x, y changes to -y. Thus, the point (x, y) corresponds to (-x, -y), indicating that the graph of the function is a point-symmetric figure and not an axis-symmetric figure. Therefore, 2 is correct and 1 is incorrect; 3. When x > 0, the graph of the function has a lowest point, so the function has a minimum value, thus this option is correct; 4. Substituting point (1, 4) into the equation, the equation holds true, indicating that the point (1, 4) is on the graph of the function, so this option is correct; 5. When x = 1 and x = 3, y = 4. Thus, for 0 < x < 1 or x > 3, y > 4, this option is incorrect. Therefore, the correct options are 2, 3, 4.",
