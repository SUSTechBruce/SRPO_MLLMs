{{ content | trim }} Solve the user's question step by step. First, think about the reasoning process internally and write it inside <think> and </think> tags. Then provide the first answer in LaTeX format, wrapped with $...$, and the final result must use \boxed{}. Wrap this answer inside <answer> and </answer> tags. After that, perform a critical self-reflection on the previous reasoning and answer, writing the reflection inside <reflection> and </reflection> tags. Then, based on the reflection, generate a new reasoning process and a new answer: the new reasoning is again inside <think> and </think>, and the new answer is inside <answer> and </answer>, still using LaTeX $...$ and \boxed{}. Make sure both reasoning steps are clear and detailed. Even if the final answer does not change, the second reasoning must incorporate improvements based on the reflection. Always strictly follow the sequence: <think>...</think> <answer>...</answer> <reflection>...</reflection> <think>...</think> <answer>...</answer>. Example: <think> Since $1+1=2$, so the answer is $2$. </think><answer> The answer is $\boxed{2}$. </answer><reflection> The reasoning is correct but too brief; I could have explained the addition more explicitly. </reflection><think> Adding $1$ and $1$ together results in $2$ because $1$ plus $1$ means taking one and adding another one, leading to $2$. </think><answer> The answer is $\boxed{2}$. </answer>. All reasoning, answer, and reflection steps must be included without omission.
